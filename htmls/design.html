                I studied Mechanical Engineering and have a strong interest in applying my knowledge to real-world projects in industry. One of the ways I enjoy doing this is through 3D design in my free time. I’m passionate about hands-on work and have created a variety of objects using SolidWorks, which I’ve brought to life using 3D printers at the University of Auckland.
                On this page, I’ll share some of my designs—let’s explore them together.

                <h2>
                    The CNC carved logo of The University of Auckland
                </h2>
                <div class="design-item-content">
                    <div class="design-item-text">
                        <p>
                            As a creative project, I designed a custom logo for The University of Auckland and brought it to life through digital design, CNC carving, and hand painting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The journey began in SolidWorks, where I created a detailed 3D model of the logo. Once the design was finalized, I exported it as an STL file, ready for carving. The file was then transferred to the computer connected to a small CNC machine at the university’s Unleash Space — a maker’s paradise where ideas meet machines!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To begin the carving process, I first used a thick CNC bit to shape out the coarse and broader features of the design. Then, to capture the intricate details and subtle curves, I switched to a smaller, finer bit that gently etched the wood with precision. It was mesmerizing to watch the machine reveal the logo layer by layer!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the carving was complete, I carefully cut the piece into a neat rectangular frame using a saw, giving it a clean and polished look. But the real magic happened in the final stage — painting! Using fine brushes and vibrant acrylic paints, I brought the logo to life with color, patiently adding depth and contrast to each part of the design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finished piece not only showcases the university's emblem but also reflects the blend of engineering, craftsmanship, and artistic expression — a small wooden tribute to innovation and creativity at The University of Auckland!

                            As a creative 3D design project, I brought not one — but two unique Kiwi birds to life using CAD and 3D printing!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using SolidWorks, I carefully designed each Kiwi with its own character and style. One design featured a more realistic, traditional look, staying true to the Kiwi’s natural shape, while the other took on a more playful and stylized form, adding a bit of personality and charm. Balancing artistic creativity with printable geometry was both a fun and technical challenge!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once satisfied with the models, I exported them and fired up the Prusa 3D printer. Layer by layer, the birds came to life in the printing bay — watching them slowly build up from nothing felt like magic. Each Kiwi emerged with its own distinct identity, full of charm and proudly standing as a symbol of New Zealand’s unique wildlife and innovation culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project was a fantastic mix of engineering, design, and creativity, and a great reminder that even something as iconic as a Kiwi can be reimagined in new and exciting ways through the world of 3D printing.

                    Laser cut ABI Logo

                            As someone with a strong interest in designing artefacts and logos, I took on a creative project to design a custom logo for the Auckland Bioengineering Institute (ABI) — blending meaningful symbolism with modern fabrication techniques.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using Adobe Photoshop, I designed the letters "ABI" with a twist:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The “A” was represented by a compass, symbolizing direction, precision, and engineering.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The “B” was formed by a heart, reflecting the institute’s connection to human health and biomedical research.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    And the “I” was illustrated using a DNA strand, capturing the essence of bioengineering at its core.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Once the digital design was complete, I prepared it for laser fabrication. Using a laser cutter, I engraved and cut the design onto a sheet of material, transforming my symbolic concept into a polished, physical artefact. Watching the laser etch these meaningful forms into reality was incredibly rewarding!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project was not just about making a logo — it was about telling a visual story that celebrates engineering, biology, and human-centered research, all through thoughtful design and hands-on making.

                    Stationery Box for Waiparuru Hall

                            To help keep the reception desk at Waipārūrū Hall looking tidy and professional, I designed a custom stationery box featuring the hall’s logo — combining functionality with a touch of personalization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal was to create an organized space for pens, notepads, and small office items that often clutter the desk. I designed the box with clean lines and thoughtful compartments, making it both practical and visually appealing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To give it a distinctive identity, I added the Waipārūrū Hall logo to the design — turning a simple box into a branded and welcoming piece of desk decor. The final result not only improved the reception’s appearance but also reflected the hall’s spirit and attention to detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everyone loved it! The feedback was so positive that I went on to design a smaller, personal version of the box for some of my colleagues. It was a fun way to share the design and bring a little order (and style) to their workspaces too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project combined my interest in practical design, branding, and problem-solving — showing how small ideas can make a big difference in shared environments.
